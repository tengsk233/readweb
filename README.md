## Background  
The website developed by the project is mainly for reading lovers. While solving the problem of paper books occupying space and consuming resources, it can also provide users with more considerate services. The website collects most of the books on the whole network, and almost all users can find the books they are interested in here; the user mechanism and the bookshelf function can provide a great solution for many book lovers who want to have a bookshelf but have nowhere to place it. We provide a dedicated library. For those who love to read, it is often very troublesome to find a good book. Therefore, our website also realizes the random home page push of books, which allows readers to understand the corresponding outline of the book and everyone's evaluation. In order to let every user can Find your favorite book here.  
## Project development environment
1. The front end requires a web browser, and because different browsers have different caching strategies for the cache, which has an impact on the css style, the chrome browser was finally used uniformly after testing.  
2. The server requires a Java runtime environment, uses the Spring Boot framework, and uses Mybatis to provide data persistence support.  
3. The hardware environment is an ordinary personal PC, and the operating system is win10.
